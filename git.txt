Exercise: 3) What is the output of git cat-file -p 83484f | tail -4 | head -1? Briefly explain what this command does.

Ans - 
  output - 
    100644 blob f55d4083edd518a0dad26a37ac4d5c6877184c4f    tutorial.txt
  Explanation - 
    1. git cat-file gives us the information for the repository objects.
    2. the -p option "pretty-prints" the contents of the object based on its type.
    3. tail -4 gives us the last 4 lines of the output 
    4. head -1 gives us the first line.

    So, git cat-file -p 83484f | tail -4 | head -1 this way, git cat-file extecutes and gives us the result and since that command ran successfully the tail -4 command runs and gives us the last 4 lines. Since, the tail command executed successfully, the head -1 will run and give us the first line from the output given by the tail command.
