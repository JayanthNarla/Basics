  return type - int
  method name - cmd_worktree
  parameters - ac, av, prefix

Exercise: 2) What is the latest version of the release notes (RelNotes....txt) for the git repository?

Exercise: 3) What is the output of git cat-file -p 83484f | tail -4 | head -1? Briefly explain what this command does.

*NOTE* - If we run the command in the terminal "tree.sh" the command executes. But, if we execute the same command in the terminal "script6.sh" that you've asked to use for exercise 3 it throws "No such file or Directory Exists". I think the shell file "script6" isn't present in the directory or something of that sort.

Below is the explanation for the output given in terminal names "tree.sh", assuming it's the correct output. Since, it isn't working in the terminal "script6.sh".

Ans - 
  output (when run in terminal named "tree.sh")- 
    100644 blob f55d4083edd518a0dad26a37ac4d5c6877184c4f    tutorial.txt
  Explanation - 
    1. git cat-file gives us the information for the repository objects.
    2. the -p option "pretty-prints" the contents of the object based on its type.
    3. tail -4 gives us the last 4 lines of the output 
    4. head -1 gives us the first line.

    So, git cat-file -p 83484f | tail -4 | head -1 this way, git cat-file extecutes and gives us the result and since that command ran successfully the tail -4 command runs and gives us the last 4 lines. Since, the tail command executed successfully, the head -1 will run and give us the first line from the output given by the tail command.
