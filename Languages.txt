- What is your favorite programming language? Why?
  Favourite Programming Language is Python and Javascript because of their convenience. Python is a language with a small learning curve, it’s code similar to how we talk (more or less). This is the language with which I got started with programming, The time taken to learn and get started with projects using python is very less and hasn't been that daunting.

  After python, Javascript is my next in line, as it is powerful language with which we can pretty much do everything starting from web development to machine learning
